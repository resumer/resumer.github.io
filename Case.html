	<tr><p>Computer cases usually include sheet metal enclosures for a power supply unit and drive bays, as well as a rear panel that can accommodate peripheral connectors protruding from the motherboard and expansion slots. Most cases also have a power button or switch, a reset button, and LEDs to indicate power status as well as hard drive, and network activity (in some models). Some cases include built-in I/O ports (such as USB and headphone ports) on the front of the case. Such a case will also include the wires needed to connect these ports, switches and indicators to the motherboard.</p></tr>

	<tr><p>The motherboard is usually screwed to the case along its largest face, which could be the bottom or the side of the case depending on the form factor and orientation.
Form factors such as ATX provide a back panel with cut-out holes to expose I/O ports provided by integrated peripherals, as well as expansion slots which may optionally expose additional ports provided by expansion cards. Many larger ATX cases can also be used with motherboards of other form factors.
The power supply unit mounting point differs from case to case, but the most commonly used locations (both at the rear of the case) and their benefits/disadvantages are:
The top of the case, usually allowing the PSU's built-in fan to act as an auxiliary exhaust fan, but causes the PSU to be fed air heated by the internal components of the case, thus causing PSU efficiency and lifespan degradation.
The bottom of the case, with a (often filtered) vent in the bottom of the case allowing the PSU to draw cool air from the outside.
Regardless of the mounting position, the PSU will usually be attached to the case with four screws to support its weight.
Most cases include drive bays on the front of the case; a typical ATX case includes 5.25", 3.5" and 2.5" bays. In modern computers, the 5.25" bays are used for optical drives, the 3.5" bays are used for hard drives and card readers, and the 2.5" bays are used for solid-state drives.
Buttons and LEDs are typically located on the front of the case; some cases include additional I/O ports, temperature and processor speed monitors in the same area.
Vents are often found on the front, back, top, left side panel, and sometimes on the right side panel of the case. Regardless of their placement, their purpose is either to let cool air into the case, or to let hot air out. Larger vents usually allow cooling fans to be mounted via surrounding threaded screw holes. Newer cases include mountings for larger 120mm or 140mm cooling fans for quieter operation than the 80mm fans formerly common.</p></tr>
